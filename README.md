# PrestashopGoogleLogin
Simple module to Log in customers using Sign in with Google One Tap user experience

Checked PS 1.7.8.0 and 8.0.1

Effortless module to enable customer login using Google's One Tap sign-in experience

This module adds a login button and embeds the login script on all pages. When a user is logged into their Google account, the script will automatically prompt them to log in to PrestaShop using their Google credentials.

The module will either log the user in or create a new customer account (not as a guest) using the provided email address. 
If the user has already entered their first and last names in the Google authentication system, these details will be used when creating the PrestaShop customer account. Otherwise, a placeholder will be used.

Every Login and Customer creation writes entry to Prestashop Log.

The module's admin configuration page includes step-by-step setup instructions.
